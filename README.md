Hydropower Long Short-Term Memory

Aims:
1) Develop a LSTM algorithm for a DSST in a set of catchments within the UK and compare the LSTM performance against a the performance of a hydrological model ensemble


Examples of the LSTM setup for one of the catchments can be found in beddgelert_tascal.py (using temperature as variable to set the DSST, going from cold to warm) and in beddgelert_precipcal.py (using precipitation as variable to set the DSST, going from dry to wet).

Plotting of the LSTM results are done using LSTM_results_plot.py
